# REPOSITORIES
#   - can be defined here or included from another file
#   - bottle will search repositories in the order defined here
#   - local/custom mirrors can be added here or in separate files
#   - repositories listed first will take precedence when packages
#     have identical names, regardless of version number
#   - URLs will have $repo replaced by the name of the current repo
#   - URLs will have $arch replaced by the name of the architecture
#
# Repository entries are of the format:
#       [repo-name]
#       Server = ServerName
#       Include = IncludePath
#
# The header [repo-name] is crucial - it must be present and
# uncommented to enable the repo.
#

# An example of a disabled remote package repository with multiple servers
# available. To enable, uncomment the following lines. You can add preferred
# servers immediately after the header and they will be used before the
# default mirrors.
